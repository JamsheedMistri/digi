----

Digi is an open source framework for building lightweight digital twins ("digi") and running them in a cloud-native architecture. Digis are programmable in Python, configurable via declarative API, and queryable for fast, in-situ data analytics. They can be composed to form control hierarchies and to model sophisticated real-world interactions. 

----

## Getting started
Install Digi with: `make dep` and `make install`. 

See [quickstart page](docs/quickstart.md) for more information on installation and frequently used commands.

As a hello-world example, one can use Digi to build a control hierarchy and query the digis in a smart space:
