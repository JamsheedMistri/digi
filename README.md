Digi is an open source framework for building lightweight digital twins ("digi") and running them in a cloud-native architecture. Digis are programmable in Python, configurable via declarative API, and queryable for fast, in-situ data analytics. One can compose digis to form control hierarchies and model sophisticated real-world interactions.
